# FARBS-Dotfiles
Dotfiles (configuration files) for an Arch Linux installation using FARBS (fork of LARBS).

This repo is automatically pulled in when installing using our modified LARBS installation script and contains all the configuration we want, including profiles for some extra personalization. 

You can find the original installation script by Luke Smith over here:

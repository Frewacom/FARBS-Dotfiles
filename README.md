# FARBS-Dotfiles
Dotfiles (configuration files) for an Arch Linux installation using FARBS (fork of LARBS).

This repo is automatically pulled in when installing using our modified LARBS installation script and contains all the configuration we want, 
including custom profiles for some extra personalization. Installation is not really supposed to be done manually without the use of the installation script, 
but it is certainly possible. Simply clone the repo into .dotfiles in your home directory, and run the post-setup in .local/bin/ftools.
